# Entrepreneurship
All,

After going through the "Introduction to the Course" Section, I tried to put some goals for myself and also listed some key concepts that I think will help me circle back, as I go along the course. Not sure how much help it will be but I am thinking of updating these sections after every module. Hopefully this strategy will help me and others to understand the course material better.

Let me know what you think.
